# /Next-AlphaFold - Structure Elucidation Pipeline

A machine learning pipeline for structure elucidation of organic compounds (30–3000 Da) using MS, MS/MS, and NMR data. Predicts SMILES, 3D structures (.glb), and performance scores, with enhanced stereochemistry prediction.

## Features
- Processes MS, MS/MS, NMR data (image/CSV).
- Predicts SMILES with stereochemistry.
- Outputs 3D structure (.glb) and 5 scores: MS/MS Fit, NMR Fit, Stereo Score, RMSD, TM-score-like.
- Handles isomers and large molecules (>1500 Da).

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/sangeet-sharma//Next-AlphaFold.py.git
   cd wild.py
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   Required: `numpy`, `torch`, `rdkit`, `requests`, `scikit-learn`, `scipy`, `py3Dmol`, `trimesh`, `opencv-python`, `pytesseract`, `pywt`.

## Usage
Run the pipeline with MS, MS/MS, and NMR files:
```
python wild.py
```
- **Input**: File paths for MS, MS/MS, NMR (image: .jpg/.png, or CSV).
- **Output**: 
  - SMILES string (with stereochemistry).
  - 3D structure (.glb).
  - Results file (.txt) with molecular formula, mass, fragments, and scores.

## Example
```bash
Enter the output directory: ./output
Processing MS-paclitaxel.jpg, Ms-ms28-01027-g001.jpg, Taxol425_NMR.jpg:
Predicted SMILES: CC1(C)[C@@H]2CC[C@@]3(C)...
3D GLB Path: ./output/output_3d.glb
Results TXT Path: ./output/results.txt
```
